        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Students often face difficulties in finding affordable and suitable housing near their academic institutions. Traditional rental platforms tend to have overwhelming options that may not meet students' unique needs, such as short-term leases, shared living spaces, or proximity to universities. Additionally, students face challenges in finding trustworthy housemates, especially younger students requiring parental consent for housing arrangements. Furthermore, very few platforms focus on providing a secure process for both students and their parents to engage in housing decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>
            A "Tinder-like" mobile application for students seeking rental spaces.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Swipe-Based Interface:</strong> Students can swipe right to express interest or left to dismiss rental properties and potential roommates. The user-friendly interface makes the search process simple and enjoyable, while filtering results based on location, price, and roommate preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive Rental Listings:</strong> Property owners or landlords can list student-friendly accommodations, complete with details like rent, utilities, house rules, and proximity to the university. Listings may also indicate whether the property owner is looking for shared accommodations to assist students seeking cost-effective living options.</li>
            <li><strong>Roommate Compatibility Algorithm:</strong> Students can create profiles highlighting their roommate preferences (e.g., budget, cleanliness, lifestyle). An algorithm will match students with potential roommates who align with these criteria, increasing the chances of successful shared living arrangements.</li>
            <li><strong>Parental Consent for Minors:</strong> For students under 18, the app will require parental consent before finalizing any rental agreements. Parents can participate in the entire rental process, ensuring their childâ€™s safety. Identity verification for both landlords and tenants (via official IDs or student IDs) adds an extra layer of security.</li>
            <li><strong>In-App Messaging:</strong> RoomSwipe will include a secure messaging feature, eliminating the need for third-party apps. Tenants, landlords, and housemates can communicate directly within the platform, with parents involved in conversations for minors.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Contracts and Payment System:</strong> Users can create rental contracts and set automated reminders for rent and shared expenses, such as utilities, all managed within the app for seamless transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Ratings and Reviews:</strong> Tenants and landlords can rate each other, ensuring transparency and accountability. The review system builds trust within the platform, helping users make informed decisions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            RoomSwipe addresses the challenges students face in finding affordable, safe, and convenient housing while simplifying the process of selecting trustworthy roommates. By incorporating parental involvement and secure in-app communication, the app offers a reliable solution for students and their families.
